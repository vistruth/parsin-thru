# parsin-thru

Parsin-Thru is an interactive parser and file extractor! It is a command line tool written in Python for extracting images and files from PCAP files along with IPV4 statistics  for future analysis and for analyzing log files.

Parsing-Tru was created to parse log files in a blink of an eye. 

We also included some informational sections in there. User can get an info on “What are pcap and log files”,  “the other ways to extract objects from pcap files” and  “other ways of parsing files”. 

Before using Parsing-thru please change your directory to the directory where the files you want to use are stored.
